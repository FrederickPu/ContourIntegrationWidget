# Contour Integration Widget
Lean4 User Widget for visualizing contour integration proofs. This repo is a modification of the  (ProofWidgets4)[https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4] repo.

My contribution is the `Contour.lean` file found in `demos/contour.lean` for all of the interfacing with the lean4 server as well as the `widget/Contour.js` file which handels scaling the contours so that they can be properly visualized.
