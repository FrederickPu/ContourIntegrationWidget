# Contour Integration Widget
Lean4 User Widget for visualizing contour integration proofs. This repo is a modification of the  [ProofWidgets4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/ProofWidgets4) repo.

My contribution is the [Contour.lean](https://github.com/FrederickPu/ContourIntegrationWidget/blob/main/ProofWidgets/Demos/Contour.lean) for all of the interfacing with the lean4 server as well as the [contour.tsx](https://github.com/FrederickPu/ContourIntegrationWidget/blob/main/widget/src/contour.tsx) file which handels scales and displays the contours.
